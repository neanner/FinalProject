      <span>'Ello! my name is Jeanna and I am learning how to take pictures!</span> <span class="mobile">Last Christmas, I received my first DSLR camera. A few months later, my first friend engagement happened and I volunteered myself
      to take photos for her to use for her save the dates. From there, I started to get requests from other friends one by one.</span> <span>My approach
      to photography is to let the subjects that I work with be themselves and interact with the camera however they feel the most comfortable.
      I enjoy picking the setting of the photograph and letting the subject choose how they would like to pose.</span> <span class="mobile">While I still have
      a long way to go in terms of technical precision, I've found that some of the best photos I have seen capture the essence of a moment instead
      of being just a pristine shot. What I aim for in any photoshoot that I do, is to find those moments that reflect the subject's personality
      and capture them as best as I can.</span> <span>People first, always.</span>
